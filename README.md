# Extendible-Hashing
There are numerous methods for collision resolution like (Open addressing,Chaining,Multiple hashing), however when the collisions are too much it is time to resize the file. Resizing file can be made dynamically using extendible hashing, dynamic hashing and other algorithms. This repository will go through the implementation of extendible hashing.
